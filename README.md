# Sum-of-lower-and-upper-triangular-matrix
#Algorithm for the sum of the part the matrix lower 
Start
Declare the input matrix.
Initialize the matrix.
If the number of rows and columns are not equal then it is not possible to display the sum of the elements of the lower triangle.
If the number of rows is equal to the number of columns, then proceed for the calculation of lower triangular elements.
Using two for loops traverse through the elements.
If (r>=c), then add all the elements.
Display the final result.
Stop.
